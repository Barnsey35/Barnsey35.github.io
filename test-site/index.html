    <p>The Last of Us was developed by Naughty Dog and released on the PlayStation 3 in 2013. It is a story driven, third person adventure game that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. The game was met with astounding critical acclaim upon launch and quickly became a commercial success. It is often regarded as one of the greatest games of all time and has sold over 20 million copies. Its success led to the release of an expansion pack, the Last of Us: Left Behind, a PlayStation 4 remaster and a direct sequel, the Last of Us Part II. </p>
    <p>I originally played the Last of Us on the PlayStation 3 and was far from impressed when I did. The game received praise to the heavens and back, yet when I played it, nothing stood out to me as particularly impressive. Due to the game being overwhelmingly well received and hyped up, there is a high likelihood I was resistant to being taken in and did the game a disservice by not being willing to properly engage with it. </p>
